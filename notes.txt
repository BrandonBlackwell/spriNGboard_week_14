1. Why is the test failing?  
- The test is failing because the amount of numbers produced does not equal the amount of numbers consumed.

2. What do you suspect is the root cause of the failure?  
- The consumer threads are not communicating to the producers that
they are done consuming. So, the producers have no idea the rate/speed the consumers can handle.

3. Why does the main thread join() the producers before setting done = true?
- This allows the producer threads to finish executing before done is set to true. 
- This pauses the consumer and main threads execution.

Uncomment LINE A and run the code.  What changes in the output?
- The consumers now poll.

Should the condition variable be passed by value or by reference?  
- By reference. 

Why?
- We have to pass by reference. The other threads need to know that the state of the condition variable 
which means we need to update the original.

Modify the producer code to correctly use the condition variable to notify a consumer each time it inserts an item into the queue.  Rerun the test.
Does the test pass? If so, why?  If not, why not?
- No, the producer threads does not notify the consumer thread. 

Update the consumer code to correctly use the condition variable to avoid busy waiting.
Does the test pass?  If not, can you spot any logic errors in the consumer that would prevent all the items in the queue from being processed?  Fix them.

- No, the test does not pass.
